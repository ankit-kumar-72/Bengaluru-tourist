            <p>
                Bangalore, officially known as Bengaluru, is the Capital of the Indian
                State of Karnataka . It has a population of over ten million, making
                it a megacity and the Third populous City and 5th most populous urban
                agglomeration in India. It is located in Southern India on the Deccan
                Pleteau . Its elevation is over 900 m (3,000 ft) above sea level, the
                highest of India’s major cities. A succession of South Indian
                dynasties, the Western Gangas, the Cholas and the Hoysalas, ruled the
                present region of Bangalore until in 1537 CE, Kempé Gowdā – a feudal
                ruler under the Vijayanagara Empire – established a mud fort
                considered to be the foundation of modern Bangalore. In 1638, the
                Marāthās conquered and ruled Bangalore for almost 50 years, after
                which the Mughals captured and sold the city to the Mysore Kingdom of
                the Wadiyar dynasty. It was captured by the British after victory in
                the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War (1799), who returned administrative
                control of the city to the Maharaja of Mysore. The old city developed
                in the dominions of the Maharaja of Mysore and was made capital of the
                Princely State of Mysore, which existed as a nominally sovereign
                entity of the British Raj. In 1809, the British shifted their
                cantonment to Bangalore, outside the old city, and a town grew up
                around it, which was governed as part of British India. Following
                India’s independence in 1947, Bangalore became the capital of Mysore
                State, and remained capital when the new Indian state of Karnataka was
                formed in 1956. The two urban settlements of Bangalore – city and
                cantonment – which had developed as independent entities merged into a
                single urban centre in 1949. The existing Kannada name, Bengalūru, was
                declared the official name of the city in 2006.

                        inscriptions. The bracing air and serene environs of Nandi Hills,
                        perched at an altitude of 4850 feet above sea level, provided the
